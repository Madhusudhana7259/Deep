Project Title
Student Performance Prediction

Description
This project aims to predict student performance based on various features such as study time, family background, and school-related factors. The primary objective is to identify students at risk of underperforming and provide insights that can help in improving their academic outcomes. The project also utilizes MLflow for experiment tracking and follows a modular coding approach to ensure code readability and reusability.

### Introduction
In the field of education, predicting student performance is crucial for implementing timely interventions. This project uses machine learning techniques to analyze and predict student grades based on various attributes. It also integrates MLflow for efficient experiment tracking and follows a modular coding structure to enhance maintainability and scalability.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project is publicly available and includes features such as:
- Demographic data (age, gender)
- Academic performance (previous grades)
- Socio-economic status (parental education, family income)
- School-related information (study time, school support)

### Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install these dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn mlflow
```

### Usage
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Madhusudhana7259/Student-Performance-Prediction.git
cd Student-Performance-Prediction
```
Run the main script to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate the results:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Models and Techniques
The project employs several machine learning algorithms to predict student performance:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.

### Results
The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results are visualized using plots for better interpretability.

### ML Life Cycle 
The end-to-end machine learning lifecycle, ensuring reproducibility and easy comparison of different models and parameters.

### Modular Coding
The project follows a modular coding approach, breaking down the code into reusable and well-defined modules. This structure enhances code readability, maintainability, and allows for easy testing and debugging. Each module is responsible for a specific task, such as data preprocessing, model training, or evaluation.
